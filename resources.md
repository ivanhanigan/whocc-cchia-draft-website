#   <a name="training"></a>Our training

An important component of improving this understanding is to build capacity at the local and regional level. Centre staff are involved in teaching within the School of Public Health. The following programs in environmental health are currently available: 

-    Bachelor of Science (Health Safety and Environment)  
-    Graduate Diploma in Environmental Health  
-    Master of Public Health – Environment Health Major  
-    Master of Philosophy (Public Health)  
-    Doctor of Philosophy (Public Health)  

Education and training may involve training programs in Australia or distance learning. The aim of these is to produce qualified and skilled professionals able to enhance the development and application of Climate Change and HIA within their region. 

##    Research students 

Changing minds, lives and the world 

The WHO CC welcomes Masters, Doctoral and Post-Doctoral level domestic and international research students who have a strong interest in the areas of Health Impact Assessment and climate change related to the Asia-Pacific region.  

Please see the links here: https://research.curtin.edu.au/our-researchers/?type=supervisors  

Research focus areas can range from but not limited to: 

-    Understanding the process of integrating climate change and HIA in the Asia-Pacific region  
-    Exploring the institutional and governance challenges in operationalising HIA and climate change in various developing country contexts  
-    Developing new HIA methodologies that are contextually grounded in local realities and local knowledge systems  
-    Developing innovative tools/frameworks for monitoring and evaluating HIA and climate change assessments that can support national health planning efforts  
-    Crafting novel dissemination products related to HIA and climate change that can inform health practitioners and policy makers  

Research at Curtin is nationally and internationally recognised and the WHO Collaborating Centre welcomes research proposals that can support its key Terms of Reference. As a research student at Curtin, you will work closely with external stakeholders to create solutions to global problems and write a thesis under the guidance of a supervisor
