<h3 id="collaborative-research"><a name="head-collres"></a>Collaborative research</h3>

<p>The Centre provides a focus for research and development, education and consulting activities in the Asia Pacific region for all aspects of Climate Change and HIA.</p>

<p>The Centre aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>increase the availability of training and education packages on topics relevant to Climate Change and HIA</li>
  <li>Provide research and development and consultancy work; and</li>
  <li>collaborate with organisations and institutions in the Western Pacific / Asia Pacific region.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre plans, conducts, and evaluates  Climate Change and HIA research, communicating results at regional and International forums.</p>

<p>The Centre can provide support for the development of methods and approaches for research into aspects of Climate Change and HIA at regional institutions.</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-and-health"><a name="head-ccres"></a>Climate change and health</h3>

<p>The current trends in climatic change will impact human populations and have the potential to become a significant threat to public health. Individuals and communities will need to adapt to  and mitigate these changed environmental circumstances to avoid adverse consequences.</p>

<p>The World Health Organisation has acknowledged that populations face risks to health from climate change.  These risks include heat stress, waterborne, food borne and vector borne diseases, respiratory diseases due to air pollution, and psychosocial concerns from the displacement of people. There is also the potential for indirect effects on health associated with changes to water supplies and food production.  Building resilient health systems, using transdisciplinary approaches and systems thinking will be critical if we are to withstand the impacts of climate change and other stresses.</p>

<p>The Centre participates in climate change and health activities through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development and promotion of the use of an HIA framework in public health adaptation to climate change risks</li>
  <li>Research to increase knowledge and understanding of the health impacts from climate change</li>
  <li>Partnerships with institutions involved in responding to climate change</li>
  <li>Membership in the NHMRC Healthy Environments And Lives (HEAL) National Research Network</li>
  <li>Development and implementation of training for vulnerability and adaptation assessments</li>
  <li>Development and participation in research projects, consultancies and visiting WHO Fellowships relevant to climate change and health TODO check Fellowships status</li>
</ul>
