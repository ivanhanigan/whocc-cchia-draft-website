<p>A better understanding of the links between environmental quality and human health.</p>

<p>An important component of improving this understanding is to build capacity at the local and regional level.</p>

<p><img src="images/news-course-dev-336x336.png" alt="pic-training" /></p>

<p>Capacity development has been defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…the process by which individuals, organisations and societies strengthen their ability to address environmental issues, manage natural resource issues, and mainstream environmental sustainability into development policies, plans and decisions.”</p>
  <h4 id="united-nations-development-program">United Nations Development Program</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>Centre staff are involved in teaching within the School of Public Health.  The following programs in environmental health are currently available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bachelor of Science (Health Safety and Environment)</li>
  <li>Graduate Diploma in Environmental Health</li>
  <li>Master of Public Health – Environment Health Major</li>
  <li>Master of Philosophy (Public Health)</li>
  <li>Doctor of Philosophy (Public Health)</li>
</ul>

<p>Education and training may involve training programs in Australia or distance learning.  The aim of these is to produce qualified and skilled professionals able to enhance the development and application of Climate Change and HIA within their region.</p>

<p>TODO check status = Short courses and <a href="http://ehia.curtin.edu.au/about/visiting-fellows/">fellowship programs</a> in specific areas of Cli.ate Change and HIA are also available.</p>
