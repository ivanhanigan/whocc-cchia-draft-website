Our work is focused on strengthening capacity of WHO Member Countries to implement HIA that integrate climate change issues and enable Members to meet their sustainable development agenda. Our work ranges from developing practical HIA guidance notes and tools to training and capacity building initiatives related to HIA. A key focus is also undertaking innovative research on HIA and its application to sustainable development and climate change.

### <a name="head-history"></a>Our history

Our first designation as a Collaborating Centre was awarded in 2003 by the WHO in recognition of our pioneering work in the area of HIA. The Centre was successfully redesignated for its sixth four-year period in 2023.

Since our first designation, we have worked toward the advancement of HIA across the Asia Pacific, partnering with government and non-government agencies, research organisations and communities to support the work of WHO.

The Centre has been involved in projects in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Cambodia, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Vanuatu, the Philippines & Vietnam. We welcome collaborations with new partners and prospective research students in the area of climate change and HIA from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
