# Welcome to our Centre

This is a crucial update suggested here: Welcome to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Health Impact Assessment which is located at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. Our first designation as a Collaborating Centre was awarded in 2003 by the WHO in recognition of our pioneering work in the area of Health Impact Assessment (HIA). The Centre was successfully redesignated for its 5th four-year period in 2019.

Our work is focused on strengthening institutional capacity of WHO Member Countries to implement HIA. Since our first designation, we have played a critical role in the advancement of HIA across the Asia Pacific, partnering with government and non-government agencies, research organisations and communities to support the work of WHO.

Our work ranges from developing practical HIA guidance notes and tools to training and capacity building initiatives related to HIA as well as supporting various dissemination activities. A key focus is also undertaking innovative research on HIA and its application to sustainable development and climate change.

The Centre has been involved in projects in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Cambodia, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Vanuatu & Vietnam. We welcome collaborations with new partners and prospective research students in the area of HIA from the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
